Projects

SCRUM Master/Project leader
Patient Portal
Spring 2017

Website: https://patientportal.comeze.com

The PATIENT PORTAL is a web application that manages electronic patient records to provide rapid and efficient means to handle medical information of a clinic. Traditionally, a clinic uses paper-based patient records, which are expensive and take up space to maintain. Moreover, filing, retrieval of, and re-filing paper patient records are more labor intensive and less efficient compared to the electronic patient records. Using the PATIENT PORTAL shall alleviate these problems. The overall goal of the PATIENT PORTAL is to provide physicians, nurses, and clinical staff with a powerful, easy-to-use tool that securely assists them in gathering, storing, and manipulating Patients’ information.
